# Simplex

Simplex is hackable MVC php framework build in minimal specification of Model - View - Controller. So you need build your own library to grow bigger app.

### Version
Alpha

### Tech

Simplex uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Bower] - Easy way to mannage your assets such as js, css etc.
* [Composer] - Easy way to manage your php libraries.

And of course Simplex itself is open source with a [public repository]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Just run it on your favorite php-mysql server (XAMPP, WAMP etc). The configure following file:

```
--- Simplex\application\config\main.ini.php
home = 'replace with your own domain';
default_controller = 'replace with your desired default controller';
```

```
--- Simplex\application\config\database.ini.php
dbhost = "your own database host here";
dbname = "your own database name here";
dbusername = "your own database username here";
dbpassword = "your own database password here";
```
